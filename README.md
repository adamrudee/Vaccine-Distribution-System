# Vaccine-Distribution-System
This project is a Java-based Vaccine Distribution System that aims to streamline vaccine allocation and delivery.  It is primarily intended for usage by healthcare organizations, clinics, and government agencies that distribute vaccines to the general population.  The system effectively monitors vaccine inventory, price, and distribution status.

 What distinguishes this system is its usage of Java data structures such as LinkedList and Queue.  The LinkedList manages dynamic lists of registered users or vaccine batches, allowing for quick updates and flexible storage.  The queue structure simulates real-world problems such as managing vaccine recipients' orders and assuring a first-come, first-served scheduling process.

 This project exhibits the practical application of object-oriented programming techniques to solve real-world public health challenges.
